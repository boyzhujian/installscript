1.     Show connected disks.

          ls -lha /vmfs/devices/disks/

               (Verify the disk is seen.  You will probably see your disk ID then :1.  This is a partition on the disk.  We only need to work about the main disk ID.)

 

2.     Show the error on disk.

          partedUtil getptbl /vmfs/devices/disks/(disk ID)

               (It will probably indicate that the GPT is located beyond the end of the disk.)

 

3.     Wipe disk and rewrite with a basic MSDOS partion.

          partedUtil setptbl /vmfs/devices/disks/(disk ID) msdos

               (The output from this should be similar to msdos and the next line will be o o o o)
