# # TCP or UDP 'ping' given url and collect response time in seconds
# [[inputs.net_response]]
#   ## Protocol, must be "tcp" or "udp"
#   ## NOTE: because the "udp" protocol does not respond to requests, it requires
#   ## a send/expect string pair (see below).
#   protocol = "tcp"
#   ## Server address (default localhost)
#   address = "localhost:80"
#   ## Set timeout
#   timeout = "1s"
#
#   ## Set read timeout (only used if expecting a response)
#   read_timeout = "1s"
#
#   ## The following options are required for UDP checks. For TCP, they are
#   ## optional. The plugin will send the given string to the server and then
#   ## expect to receive the given 'expect' string back.
#   ## string sent to the server
#   # send = "ssh"
#   ## expected string in answer
#   # expect = "ssh"
