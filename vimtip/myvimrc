#  :set is for setting options, :let for assigning a value to a variable.

It happens that the value for an option is linked to the name of the option prepended by a & (the &option-name construct then behaves very similar to "ordinary" variables). So, the following are equivalent:

:set  tw=40
:let &tw=40
But, for example, assigning 50 to the global variable foo (:let g:foo=50) cannot be achieved with a :set command (because g:foo is a variable and not an option).

Some options are boolean like. When setting these, no value is needed (as in :set noic and the opposite :set ic).
